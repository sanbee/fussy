Changes in table.cc (Calc_Symbol *installConst(Calc_Symbol&d,int NewID))
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The strategy of managing the table of constants is the following now:
  calcgetConst() for NUMBER_TYPES always returns NULL
  A constant is always put on the table and a new ID assigned depending 
   upon NewID
  Since its always pushed at the end, pick up the pointer to the latest
   constant from the end
  if in function/procedure compilation set symb->name[0] to 1
   
Cleanup() cleans up the ConstTab of all symbols which are not
referenced. i.e. for which name[0] != 1.

This essentially make ConstTab is a permanent storage for constants
used in sub-program code and temp. store for constants used in vm code
for the interactive session and/or parameters (all temps).
Functionally, this then treats all constants, as indep. variates, even
if their values are the same.  Same name symbols on the SymbTab.


Changes in table.cc: void cleanupSymbTab(SymbTabType& Tab, int OP,TypeType Type=UNDEF_TYPE)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now removes unreferenced entries in the ConstTab.  These are temp. numbers that may
be generated (either in interactive sessions or while runing sub-programs).  This allows
treating all numbers are indep. variates.


Changes in fussy.y
------------------

The InFuncDefn flag is removed right a the end of func. def. code.  With this, constants
that are generated during sub-program compilation go on the ConstTab with the flag which
tells the Cleanup() that they are referenced and hence should not be removed.
===========================================================================================
                                                                      7 Aug. 2006

The above changes, while operationally correct, did not optimize the
usage of ConstTab (left a lot of redundent info. on it).  Following
changes optimizes the ConstTab for NUMBER_TYPE.  Similar optimization
can be done for other types on ConstTab.

Calc_Symbol *installConst(Calc_Symbol&d,int NewID)
-------------------------------------------------
 The strategy of managing the table of constants is the following now:
   For NUMBER_TYPE, look on ConsTab if (1) installing a number for
     sub-program code (InFuncDefn==True), and (2) the symbol being 
     installed has no error (Symbol.rms()==0).  Unless these two 
     conditions are met in calcgetConst(), it does not search in ConsTab.

     If ConsTab is searched, return an entry if (1) it is an entry
     referenced by some sub-program code - i.e., it is permanent, and
     (2) its value (including RMS) matches.
     
   In case a new symbol is added to the ConstTab, since its always
   pushed at the end, pick up the pointer to the latest constant
   from the end (instead of searching in ConsTab again!).
   
   Finally, if in function/procedure compilation set symb->name[0] to 1
   
 Cleanup() cleans up the ConstTab of all symbols which are not referenced. 
 i.e. for which name[0] != 1.

 This essentially makes ConstTab a permanent storage for constants used in
 sub-program code and temp. store for constants used in vm code for the interactive 
 session and/or parameters (all temps).
 Functionally, this then treats all constants, as indep. variates, even if their
 values are the same.  Same name symbols on the SymbTab.


Calc_Symbol *calcgetConst(Calc_Symbol& v)
----------------------------------------

 If in sub-prog. code definition and the supplied symbol will NOT
 participate in error propagation (i.e. it has no error), then proceed
 to search for in ConstTab.

     If the ConstTab entry is a referenced entry, and it is of type
     NUMBER_TYPE, and it's value (including RMS) matches, then return
     the pointer to this entry.
