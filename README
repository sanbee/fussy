FUSSY


The _fussy_ program implements a scripting language with an algorithm
for automatic error propagation of random measurement errors in an
arbitrary mathematical expression. The program can be used a simple
interactive calculator with error propagation. Mathematical expressions
can be implemented as a collection of sub-expressions, as sub-program
units (functions or procedures) or as single atomic expressions.
Sub-expressions can be assigned to temporary variables which can then be
used to write the final expression. The interpreter is internally
implemented as a virtual machine for efficient runtime performance and
can be used as an interpreter in a client code as well. A simple C
binding to the interpreter is also provided.

The scripting syntax of _fussy_ is similar to that of C programming
language. It is easy, particularly for those familiar with programming
in C, to use _fussy_ with minimal learning. In its simplest form,
_fussy_ interpretor can be used interactively as a simple calculator
with the added feature of automatic error prograpation (see syntax for
simple expressions, sub-expressions, and functions/procedure).
