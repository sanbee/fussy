                 evaluation of first and higher derivatives of vector
                 functions that are defined by computer programs written
                 in C or C++. The resulting derivative evaluation
                 routines may be called from C/C++, Fortran, or any
                 other language that can be linked with C. The numerical
                 values of derivative vectors are obtained free of
                 truncation errors at a small multiple of the run-time
                 and randomly accessed memory of the given function
                 evaluation program. Derivative matrices are obtained by
                 columns or rows. For solution curves defined by
                 ordinary differential equations, special routines are
                 provided that evaluate the Taylor coefficient vectors
                 and their Jacobians with respect to the current state
                 vector. The derivative calculations involve a possibly
                 substantial (but always predictable) amount of data
                 that are accessed strictly sequentially and are
                 therefore automatically paged out to external files.",
